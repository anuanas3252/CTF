# Python Wrangling

## PROBLEM

> Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?


## SOLUTION

1. Download all the 3 files python script, encrypted file & password txt
2. Run the script with -h as arguments

4. Now it will ask for a password & You can see the decryption password in pw.txt

5. Enter the password & it will give you the flag

## LEARNINGS

1. You should have a good knowledge in coding. I recommend Python & javascript

2. If you given a code/script, go through it try to understand what is written in it and how the code is working. Basically understand the code.

3. know more about [ASCII Code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ascii-table/)
