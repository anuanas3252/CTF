# First Grep


## PROBLEM

> Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

## SOLUTION

1. As the Heading says its about grep

2. I went for help for Grep and used the below command (Here I have selected -i as the argument, for searching the keyword ie no case sensitive)

```
grep -i 'pico' file
```

3. It will return the flag
